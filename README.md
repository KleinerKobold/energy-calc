# energy-calc
I am recording my energy consumption for a long time, and always found it awful to have different messure points. 
So this rebuild.py reads the excel file with 4 columns
|date|messure 1| messure 2| messure 3|
|---|---|---|---|

After that it interpolates everything

you need pandas and xlrd installed
